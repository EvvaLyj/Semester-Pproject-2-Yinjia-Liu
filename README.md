# File Instruction
Python files 
* simclr.py: Here is the training process for the encoder.
* run.py: The main program that performs encoder training with method A.
* runB.py: The main program that performs encoder training with method B.
* utils.py: Here are some utility functions. 


There are four folders.
* data_aug: Including various designed transform functions and the dataset class.
* exceptions: 
* models: model of the encoder (ResNet).
* feature_eval: Linear evaluation for the pre-trained encoder.
# How to implement the experiments?
<!-- Create a `tests` folder under C disk (if using another path, please modify the `filepath` in each ipynb file of folder `Experiments`). Then run the ipynb files in folder `Experiments` on Jupyter notebook.  -->
